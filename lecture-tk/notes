CPU & Components

  Transistors - most basic
  Logic Gates - made up of TransistorsDigital Logic common operations are performed by Gates
    ex. AND OR, NOT
    ex. XOR, NOR, NAND
  Logic Gates can be put together into far more complex structures:
    ex. ALU - Arithmetic Logic Unit
    ex. CPUs - Central Proccessing Unit

RAM - Random Access memory

  Fast compared to hard-drives, even SSDs
  Like a big array of bytes that you can access by index (or address)
  Each element in Ram can store oen byte, an 8-bit number
  Larger, multi-byte values are stored in sequential addresses in RAM
  CPU communicates with RAM via the memory bus
